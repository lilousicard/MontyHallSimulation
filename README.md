This code reproduces the American television game show Let's Make a Deal.
In the original game, the player would face 3 doors. One door
would hide a car, and the other two would hide a goat. The player 
wins what is behind the door he/she chooses to open.

The main idea is that once the player picks a door, the host open one 
of the two remaining to reveal a goat. With this new knowledge, the player
can now decide to keep his door or to change for the remaining closed door.
So, which option is the best?
